    My journey into the world of computing began when the first PC arrived at home when I was very young. I was fascinated by this "magic" box, not just because it displayed images, but because I could interact with the content on the screen, unlike a TV. From that moment, I knew computers would become an integral part of my life.

    I remember spending hours typing texts on the computer for my father. I quickly memorized the keyboard and dedicated a lot of time to formatting the text: colors, fonts (the few that were available).

    One day, a family friend brought us a box containing a CD with Debian. My brother and I immediately tried to install it, which took quite some time because we had no idea what we were doing. That was my first experience with a Linux distribution and KDE. Shortly after, I installed Ubuntu 8.04 and started using it more frequently.

    A few years later, I received my first personal PC with Windows XP, on which I created my first website.

    Over the years, I have nurtured my passion for design and user experience. With each project, my attention to detail grew, to the point where I found existing frameworks too bulky and generic. The interfaces felt repetitive, all using the same frameworks and designs. So, I began to exclude them from my workflow and went back to working from scratch. This approach allowed me to break free from conventional designs and create something unique.

    I have had the opportunity to shape the UX of various companies' products over the years. Since 2021, I have been dedicating myself to UI and UX for the products of fabricators.ltd, a company I co-founded with Pietro, a dear friend of mine.

    I am a strong advocate of Open Source, and in my spare time, I work on personal projects and contribute to others.
